        "question": "Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?\n",
        "answer": " 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes is 3*cupcakes - 2.\nLet x be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.\nSo the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2.\nCarly makes a total of 2x + 3x - 2 = 5x - 2 cupcakes and brownies.\nCarly's class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats so she needs to make 5*2 = 10 treats in total.\nTherefore, Carly made x = 10 - (5x - 2) = 10 - 5x + 2 = 12 - 5x cupcakes.\nSo the answer is: 12</s>",
